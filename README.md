This is a React-based portfolio application, showcasing projects and technologies used. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js and npm (Node.js package manager). You can download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Cloning the Repository

To get started with this project, you first need to clone the repository. Open your terminal and run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.

## Installing Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This command installs all the necessary dependencies required to run and build the project.

## Running the Application Locally

```

This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

This project is configured to be published to GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` package. To deploy your own version of the application to GitHub Pages, you need to make a few adjustments:

1. **Set the `homepage` in `package.json`:**
   Replace the `homepage` URL with your GitHub Pages URL, which typically looks like this:
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://<your-username>.github.io/portfolio",
   ```
   Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.

2. **Deploy the Application:**
   Run the following command to build and deploy the application to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   This script builds the app for production to the `build` folder and then pushes it to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.
